* This file exists in order to identify individual functions which will be

*   you must describe two things:
*
*    * the specific version of web2project where the behavior will change; and
*    * a reference to the new/proper way of performing the same functionality.
*
* During Minor releases, this file will grow only to shrink as Major releases
*   allow us to delete functions.

* WARNING: This file does not identify class-level method deprecations.
*   In order to find those, you'll have to explore the individual classes.

//There is an issue with international UTF characters, when stored in the database an accented letter
//actually takes up two letters per say in the field length, this is a problem with costcodes since
//they are limited in size so saving a costcode as REDACI�N would actually save REDACI� since the accent takes
//two characters, so lets unaccent them, other languages should add to the replacements array too...
